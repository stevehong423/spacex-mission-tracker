# SpaceX Mission Display App
SpaceX Mission Display App queries the SpaceX API to display a list of previous missions, and each of their details, 
in a user-intuitive and responsive display.  

App contains a "Filter" option, in which you can filter the results by Manufacturer, and "Sort" option, which you can sort
the missions alphabetically by name.

App includes a unit test, using a Mock Provider and mock data to simulate the Apollo query, and ensure data is being rendered.

I had a lot of fun working with this!  Thank you.
